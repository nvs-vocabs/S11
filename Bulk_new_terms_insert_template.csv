ephyra,ephyrula,A free-swimming precursors of the adult medusa stage stage, ephyrulae or ephyra are small medusae ("medusoid heads") that separate by budding from the polyp in a process known as strobilation before metamorphosing into little typical scyphomedusae, the life stage of the adult medusa typically identified as jellyfish. Strobils can sometimes become scyphomedusae without passing through the ephyrulae stage.,Bouillon J. 1968,
